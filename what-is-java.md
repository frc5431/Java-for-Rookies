# What is Java?

Before you can actually start programming in Java, you have to know what it is! _Duh!_

First, let me say what the Java Programming Language _isnt_:

Java is **not** a coffee bean

Java is **not **Javascript

Javascript is **not in any way related **to Java except for the name

**Do not confuse Java with Javascript or covfefe**

Now that we got that out out of the way, let's actually talk about what Java actually is.

Java is a programming language owned by Oracle Corporation. It is object oriented - something we will go over in a later chapter.

The reason we will be using Java is because it is easy for rookies to learn. It is relatively simpler than other languages like C++ and is a lot higher level.

What makes Java different from other languages is the key concept of _write once, run anywhere_. The idea is that any Java program you write can run on anything - from computers, cell phone apps, robots...

It's quite handy! You can just use one program for everything!

The way Java does this is via something called an _interpreter. Other languages like C, C++, and FORTRAN use something called a compiler_. There is a fundamental difference between these 2 concepts which is very important to know.



> Compilers? Interpreter? Object Oriented? C++? What are these words!!?!??!??!?!

...is probably what you are asking.

Everything will be answered soon, young padowan.
