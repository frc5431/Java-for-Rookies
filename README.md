# Java for Rookies

So you want to program for Team 5431 huh?

That's quite the ambitious goal! Team 5431 has the highest standards for our coding team, such as:

* At least one hole in the wall every season
* Always 2 weeks late on the promised deadline
* 1 very expensive item and 2 copies that is extensively experimented with only to be scrapped the day before Dallas regional, such as Kinect, NUC, LED's, or Jetson.
* 5 repos with names such as "finalCompCode," "realCode," "finalCompCode2017ACTUAL." But the actual repo with the competition code is "PRAC-COMP-CODE-2017"
* More humorous comments and puns in code than actual helpful documentation, such as _woaver_
* Very specific and enforced standard
* Building a turret when no one else would
* Forgetting to plug in the router
* ...and many more!

That is only a very short list of some of the very strict expectations that coding team lives up to. Sounds scary, right?

Don't fret!

Thats why this handy dandy guide is here to teach you the ways of being a 5431 programmer! It won't be easy. It won't be fast. But with some dedication and effort you will eventually become the 5431 programmer.

Some of the things that we expect from every individual programmer on our team:

* The ability to cheat on programming quizzes
* Ability to write an HTTP server
* Calculate the price of pizza for the team
* Not want to eat pizza
* Withstand yelling from Eric, Michael, Burnham, and any other student who happens to be on the field when the robot inevitably goes haywire.
* Endure many cuts on sharp pieces of metal

If you think you are up to the challenge, continue forward in this book!
