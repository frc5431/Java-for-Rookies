# What is a computer?

To really get a grip on programming, you need to get into the "programming mindset." It sounds cheesy, but it really does exist. You have to think differently from how you normally do. Not everyone has the ability to do this well.

First, lets talk about what the computer actually is for us programmers and how it works. No, this is not how a computer works:

In layman's terms, computers work with a bunch of small conductive rocks and some electricity. Basically magic.

Why is this important?

Well, you have to remember that the computer isn't alive. It's just a bunch of math and electricity. Here's a metaphor to think of it:

Imagine a little newborn baby.

Just like other babies \(no offense to babies,\) it doesn't really know anything. It was just born!

It doesn't know how to walk or talk. It only knows very basic and primitive stuff like pooping and crying. Even then, it needs to learn how to control itself.

This baby is special though. It has a couple of special powers that make it different from other babies:

* It will remember everything you tell it to until you tell it to forget it
* It understands English perfectly
* It will always be 100% obedient to every specific thing you say, even if you didn't mean it
* It will always do anything you tell it to as long as it understands, even if it hurts itself.

But because it doesn't know anything at all, you have to be super super specific and efficient in everything you tell it.

Lets say you want the baby to walk. You can't just tell it to 'walk,' because it has no idea what walking is. You have to break it down to very simple mechanical operations:

1. Left up right leg
2. Move right leg forward
3. Move right leg down
4. etc...

Even that is very simplified. Remember it doesn't know anything! It has no idea what legs are yet! You would have to go down to even simpler terms and say:

1. Contract muscle X
2. ...

It still doesn't know what a muscle is!

1. Send pulse through neuron 39243
2. ...

There we go! You had to break a relatively simple task into very specific and low-level steps for a brain to understand. What we have done in this exercise is actually _program_. This is in essence what programming is all about; what separates the good programmers from the bad programmers: the ability to break things down into logical steps.

As you program more, you will learn to understand how to do this better.

You are probably raring to go. Let's actually learn about what Java is!
