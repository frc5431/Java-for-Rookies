# Data Types

Last chapter we learned about cool things called variables and how they all have data types. We learned about the `int` and how it represents an integer.

Every data type has strict rules surrounding how they can be used. For example, an `int` can only be a whole number. The following is not allowed:

```java
int foo = 3.3;//oops! 3.3 is a decimal, not a whole number!
```

In order to use decimals, there are 2 data types: `float` and `double`. Both allow decimals. A `double` is a decimal that is 64 bits \(8 bytes\) while a `float` is 32 bits \(4 bytes.\) Obviously, the more bits a number has, the more it can store. Roughly, a `float` can store about 6-7 numbers after the decimal point while `double` can store 15-16. Additionally, a `double` is more precise doing math. Just like humans, computers round when they are dealing with large decimal numbers, so the more numbers after the decimal point, the less rounding that happens.

By default, any number you type with decimals will be a `double`. I personally recommend using a `float` whenever you can to save memory, but if you require accuracy and large decimals, always use a `double`.

[This Stack Overflow post ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27598078/float-and-double-datatype-in-java)can help explain the difference between `float` and `double` if you don't quite get it yet.

Another important data type to know is the `boolean`. A `boolean` is either `true` or `false`

What? No one said data has to be numbers!

```java
boolean foo = true;
boolean bar = false;
```

Why would you want to use a `boolean`? That will be explained later, young padowan, when we get to conditionals. Just remember it's existence...

There is another built in data type that isn't technically a number, and that is the `char`. A `char` stands for character and represents a single character of text. To represent a `char`, you put `'` \(single quote\) around a character, as so:

```java
//examples of chars
char foo = '4';
char bar = 'f';
char baz = 'â˜­';//emojis are supported characters since Java 7!

char bam = 'hello!';//WOAH! you can't do that! char's are only single characters!
```

[If you remember back from when you wrote Hello, World](/our-first-program.md) you may remember seeing some double quotes. A double quote represents a `String` which is more than one character.

```java
String foo = "I am more than one character!";

String bar = '!';//can't do this, single quotes are for char, double quotes are for String
char baz = "I am so long!";//can't do this either, double quotes are for string
```

The values in between the `""` and the `''` are called literals.

```
Literals
```

A literal is basically a value that is hard written into the code. In our previous example,

```java
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
```

`2` and `3` are both integer literals. Whenever you type them in code, they will always be an `int`. There are literals for any type.

For example, `3.3` is a `double` literal. It's type is `double`. To make it a `float` literal, you put the `f` at the end, making it `3.3f`.

```java
double foo = 3.3;//3.3 is a double literal
float bar = 3.3f;//3.3f is a float literal

float baz = 3.3;//oops! 3.3 is a double, not a float!
```

`true` and `false` are literals for `boolean`

Double quotes `"` are literals for `String` while a single quote `'` is a literal for a `char`.

Additionally, a number prefixed with `0x` is a hexadecimal value \(something you really don't need to know\) and a number prefixed with `0b` is pure binary.

## Every primitive data type

The data types we just went over are called _primitives._ They are data types built in to Java. We can create our own data type using _classes_, something we will go over soon. There are couple of other primitives not mentioned previously because they are a bit less important. You don't have to know every single small detail about every single data type. The following is a reference for the future.

| Primitive Name | What it stores | Example\(s\) of a literal | Size in memory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| int | A whole number \(no decimals\) from  -2,147,483,648 to. 2,147,483,647 | 42000000 or hexadecimal \(0x280DE80\) | 32 bits \(4 bytes\) |
| short | A whole number from -36,768 to 32,767. Basically a smaller int. | 1337 | 16 bits \(2 bytes\) |
| byte | A whole number \(no decimals\) from -128 to 127. Basically an even smaller int. | 42 or binary \(0b00101010\) | 8 bits \(1 byte\) |
| long | A whole number \(no decimals\) from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. A very huge int. Use this for big numbers. | 999999999999L or 999999999999l | 64 bits \(8 bytes\) |
| float | A decimal number with a range of 3.40282347 x 10^38 to 1.40239846 x 10^-45. Has roughly 5-6 decimal places. Less precise than a double | 3.3f | 32 bits \(4 bytes\) |
| double | A decimal number with a range of 1.7976931348623157 x 10^308 to 4.9406564584124654 x 10^-324. More precise than a float. Has roughly 15-16 decimal places. | 5.6 | 64 bits \(8 bytes\) |
| boolean | Either true or false. Used in conditional statements. | true or false | 1 bit |
| char | A single character of text. Otherwise equivalent to a short except it doesn't go into negatives \(0 - 65,535\) | 'a' or \u0041 | 16 bits \(2 bytes\) |
| String | Collection of chars. Basically text. | "Hello, world!" | Variable length. Depends on length of text. |

Here is an example showing every type of literal:

```java
int a = 42;
int b = 0x2A;//42 in hexadecimal
short c = 12;
byte d = 21;
byte e = 0b00010101;//21 in binary
long f = 99999999999L;
float g = 5.6f;
double h = 3.1459;
boolean i = true;
boolean j = false;
char k = 'a';
char l = \u0041;//'a' as a unicode code point
String m = "I am quite literally a literal!";
```

### Exercises

Feeling fearless? Try to create a variable of every data type using your literals and print it out to console! Try seeing what it prints.
