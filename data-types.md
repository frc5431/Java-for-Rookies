# Data Types

Last chapter we learned about cool things called variables and how they all have data types. We learned about the `int` and how it represents an integer.

Every data type has strict rules surrounding how they can be used. For example, an `int` can only be a whole number. The following is not allowed:

```java
int foo = 3;
```
