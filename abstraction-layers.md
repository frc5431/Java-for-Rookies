# Abstraction Layers

What we have done is taken our _goal_ and separated it into a bunch of layers, each layer getting more and more specific:

1. Walk
2. Move parts of leg
3. Move muscles in parts of leg
4. Activate neurons to move muscles in parts of leg

This is actually very similar to how a computer works! Let's say we want a computer to make a LED turn on:

1. Turn LED on
2. Send power to LED
3. Flip gate to send power through pin to activate LED
4. Send electricity through complicated series of gates and transistors to flip gate to send power through pin to activate LED

Woah! That got really complicated really fast. And that was even simplified as well!
