# Classes

To start this chapter, delete the code in your `main` function. Your Eclipse should look like this:![](/classes/eclipse-first-view)On the right, where it says `(default package)`, right click and go to New &gt; Class

![](/classes/create-new-class.png)

You should remember this step from when we wrote our Hello World program. Give your class a name of `Bicycle` and click Finish.

You should now have 2 files under `(default package)`: `HelloWorld.java` and `Bicycle.java`. Packages have an importance which we will go over later.

Each `.java` file contains a single `class` declaration. When you created `Bicycle.java`, Eclipse autogenerated it's `class` declaration. `Bicycle.java` should look like this:

```java
public class Bicycle {

}
```

A class declaration looks like this:

```java
[access] class [name] {
    [fields]
    [methods]
}
```

The `Bicycle` class is `public`. We will go over what that means later.

We can start adding fields and methods. Remember [last chapter ](//objects.md)we talked about how fields represent an object's state while methods represent it's behaviors.

You put fields and methods in between the curly brackets `{}` after the word `Bicycle`.
